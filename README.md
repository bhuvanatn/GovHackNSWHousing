This application is built using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

This application uses the data from NSW housing to show the bubble chart.

We tried to make this application interactive by showing through graphs. 
These graph shows rent and house price ranging from years.
There are many websites which shows data historically and they are paid services and hidden behind password. 
Here we are using data from government NSW Housing department which is readly available
